    So what does a message have?
    a service (twitch, beam, whatever)
    a message type (whisper, public message, direct message, etc?)
    a user (who sent the message, using the given unique identifier for a given service)
    message content = "!ogod buzzer baby"
    privilege (the privilegs of the user who sent the message)
    service uuid (the uuid of the service that sent the message)

    if more fields are required for a given service, this class should be subclassed
    the service class that uses those messages should provide helper functions
